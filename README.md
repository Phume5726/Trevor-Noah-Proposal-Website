3) services.html – Overview of programs and services provided by the foundation.

4) enquiry.html – Enquiry form for volunteering, sponsorship, or information requests.

5) contact.html – Contact information and office locations (with embedded maps).

3. Tools Used

- Visual Studio Code – for coding and project setup.
  
- HTML5 – for content structure.
  
- Google Maps Embed – for displaying office locations.
  
- (CSS styling will be added in Phase 2 of the project.)
